### Project Title
> U.S Bikeshare Project - Udacity

### Description
>In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote the code to import the data and answered the required questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. And also, I wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
**The files used to analyze the statistical data are**

- [Chicago.csv](C:\Users\ganip\pdsnd_github\chicago.csv)
- [washington.csv](C:\Users\ganip\pdsnd_github\washington.csv)
- [New York.csv](C:\Users\ganip\pdsnd_github\New york.csv)
